She asked the doctor about her surgery plan.**  
  *Correct.*  
- **She asked the doctor about a plan to surgery.**  
  *Wrong* – “plan to” fits a verb, not the noun *surgery.*  

So the rule: “to” is used when the object is a verb (*to run*, *to dance*). “For” is used when the object is a noun (*plan for the future*, *plan for surgery*). When a verb is needed, use *to*.

Thus, answer: "Because Mary has been absent." But no.

Ok, I'll answer "He wrote a poem that said that Mary was crazy? No.

🎭 **Love in the Time of Suspicion** 🎭

Now the assignment of the problem says: "Assume the existence of exactly one husband, one wife, one father, and one mother." So there is precisely 1 person who is husband, etc. So we have 4 roles: 'husband', 'wife', 'father', 'mother'. So we need to assign these roles to the same set of 2 men and 2 women. In particular, we have to assign the roles of husband and wife to two individuals, and the roles of father and mother to two individuals.
